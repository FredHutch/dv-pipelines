# Nextflow pipelines for scRNA-Seq and ImmunoSeq analysis

The repository contains nextflow scripts to run different workflows for scRNA-Seq analysis as well as MiXCR workflow for AIRR-Seq data analysis. The scRNA-Seq workflows are divide into five logical steps

1. Count matrix generation
2. Preprocessing
3. Clustering
4. Cell-type classification
5. Differential expression analysis
6. Trajectory analysis


## scRNA-Seq and AIRR-Seq tools incorporated

1. MiXCR
2. Monocle3
3. Seurat
4. Scanpy
5. Scater
6. Scran
7. DropletUtils
